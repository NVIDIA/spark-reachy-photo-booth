# Spark & Reachy Photo Booth UI

## Overview

This is the Web user interface for Spark & Reachy Photo Booth.

## Local development

Local development requires npm and Node.js. The best way to install npm and Node.js is through [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating).

Use latest version of npm and Node.js:

```bash
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

Run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The console will print the URL to view the UI.
